# OCDS for PPPs Consolidated Extension

For full documentation of OCDS for PPPs see http://standard.open-contracting.org/profiles/ppp/

This extension should always be declared by referring to the deployed version, e.g. http://standard.open-contracting.org/profiles/ppp/schema/1__0__0__beta2/extension.json

**DO NOT EDIT** the files in `docs/examples`. Instead, edit those files in the `ocds-show` repository, copy the files to the `ocds-show-ppp` repository, and then run `make update_examples`.
