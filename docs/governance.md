# History and governance

OCDS for PPPs was developed between May 2016 and May 2017 through a partnership between the World Bank Governance Global Practice (GGP), the World Bank Public Private Partnerships Cross-Cutting Solutions Area (PPP CCSA) and the Open Contracting Partnership. Open Data Services was hired to implement the development of the product.

You can read more about OCDS for PPPs and other tools for transparency and accountability in PPPs on the [World Bank Governance for Development blog](http://blogs.worldbank.org/governance/public-private-partnerships-transparency-and-accountability-where-my-data).

## Governance

As an implementation profile, extending OCDS 1.1, updates to the core schema will be subject to the [OCDS Governance Process](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/support/governance/).

It draws upon the following extensions from the [OCDS extension registry](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/extensions/). 

* ppp
* process_title
* location
* requirements
* budget
* budget_project
* documentation_details
* metrics
* risk_allocation
* shareholders
* finance
* qualification
* tariffs
* performance_failures
* signatories
* charges
* transaction_milestones
* bids
* milestone_documents

Issues related to the individual extensions that make up the implementation profile can be raised on their respective GitHub projects. 

General issues relating to their combination in this implementation profile can be raised [in the project issue tracker](https://github.com/open-contracting/public-private-partnerships/issues).

Ongoing maintenance of OCDS for PPPs will be supported by the OCDS Global Helpdesk, for enquiries please contact [data@open-contracting.org](data@open-contracting.org).
