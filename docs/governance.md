# Governance

As an implementation profile, extending OCDS 1.1, updates to the OCDS schema will be subject to the [OCDS Governance Process](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/support/governance/).

It draws upon the following extensions from the [OCDS extension registry](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/extensions/).

* ppp
* process_title
* location
* requirements
* budget
* budget_project
* documentation_details
* metrics
* risk_allocation
* shareholders
* finance
* tariffs
* performance_failures
* signatories
* charges
* transaction_milestones
* bids
* milestone_documents

Issues related to the individual extensions that make up the implementation profile can be raised on their respective GitHub projects.

General issues relating to their combination in this implementation profile can be raised [in the project issue tracker](https://github.com/open-contracting-extensions/public-private-partnerships/issues).

Ongoing maintenance of OCDS for PPPs will be supported by the OCDS Global Helpdesk, for enquiries please contact [data@open-contracting.org](mailto:data@open-contracting.org).
