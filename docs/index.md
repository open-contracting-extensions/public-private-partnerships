This provides an extended Open Contracting Data Standard schema, offering a structured data model for presenting information on Public Private Partnership Projects.

## Partners

OCDS for PPPs was developed between May 2016 and May 2017 through a partnership between the [World Bank Open Contracting team](https://blogs.worldbank.org/category/tags/open-contracting), [PPP team](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/publicprivatepartnerships), [Open Contracting Partnership](http://open-contracting.org), and [Open Data Services Co-operative](http://www.opendataservices.coop). 

Work was funded by the [Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) Multi-Donor Trust Fund](https://ppiaf.org/).
