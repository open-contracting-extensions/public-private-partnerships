This site contains technical documentation for OCDS for PPPs.

This provides an extended Open Contracting Data Standard schema, offering a structured data model for presenting information on Public Private Partnership Projects.

## Partners

OCDS for PPPs was developed between May 2016 and May 2017 through a partnership between the [World Bank Governance Global Practice (GGP)](https://blogs.worldbank.org/governance/public-private-partnerships-transparency-and-accountability-where-my-data), the [World Bank Infrastructure, Public-Private Partnerships and Guarantees (IPG) Group](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/publicprivatepartnerships), [Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org), and [Open Data Services Co-operative](https://opendataservices.coop).

Funding for this work was provided by the [Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) Multi-Donor Trust Fund](https://ppiaf.org/).
