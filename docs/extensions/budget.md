# Budget Breakdown

## Background

The `planning` section of OCDS can be used to describe the background to a contracting process, which may include details of the budget from which funds are drawn.

OCDS core includes a single `budget.amount` field to capture the total value of the budget for the contracting process.

## Providing more detailed budget information

Some OCDS implementations require more detailed information on budgets to be disclosed, for example multi-year budgets or budgets sourced from multiple different government departments. In the case of PPPs, budgets may be sourced from the private sector or from multi-lateral development banks.

This extension provides a way to describe multi-year and multi-source budgets.

Disclosing structured data on multi-source budgets allows users to understand how much of the funds for a project come from government or from a specific department, whilst structured data on multi-year budgets allows users to understand the expected spend profile of a contract.

## Extension fields

This extension adds a `budgetBreakdown` property to the `planning` section of OCDS. `budgetBreakdown` is an array of `budget` blocks.

This extension also extends the `budget` block with the following additional properties for use in the `budgetBreakdown` section:

* `budget.sourceEntity` - an organization reference, linking to the entry in the `parties` section describing the organization providing the funds for this part of the budget
* `budget.period` - a period block, describing the period to which this part of the budget applies

## Guidance

In the core `planning.budget` block:

* `budget.amount` should be used to capture the total value of the budget for the contracting process.
* `budget.period` should be used to capture the total period over which the budget applies.
* `budget.sourceEntity` should be omitted.

Where `budget.budgetBreakdown` is used to express a multi-source budget but the organization details are not known for one or more parts of the budget, for example in a PPP where part of the budget will be provided by the successful private sector bidder, the `sourceEntity.name` field should be used to provide a free text explanation of the source of the budget, e.g. "Private sector investment from successful bidder".

## Examples

### Multi-source budgets

The following JSON snippet models a single year multi-source budget:

```json
{
  "planning": {
    "budget": {
      "id": "1",
      "description": "Multi-source budget, see budget breakdown for details.",
      "amount": {
        "amount": 300000,
        "currency": "GBP"
      },
      "budgetBreakdown": [
        {
          "sourceParty": {
            "id": "GB-LAC-E09000003-557",
            "name": "London Borough of Barnet - Transport Services"
          },
          "period": {
            "startDate": "2016-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "endDate": "2016-12-31T00:00:00Z"
          },
          "id": "001",
          "description": "Budget contribution from the local government",
          "amount": {

            "currency": "GBP"
          }
        },
        {
          "sourceParty": {
            "id": "GB-GOV-23",
            "name": "Department for Transport"
          },
          "period": {
            "startDate": "2016-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "endDate": "2016-12-31T00:00:00Z"
          },
          "id": "002",
          "description": "Budget contribution from the national government",
          "amount": {
            "amount": 150000,
            "currency": "GBP"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Multi-year budgets

The following JSON snippet models a multi-year single source budget:

```json
{
  "planning": {
    "budget": {
      "id": "2",
      "description": "Multi-year budget, see budget breakdown for details.",
      "amount": {
        "amount": 300000,
        "currency": "GBP"
      },
      "budgetBreakdown": [
        {
          "period": {
            "startDate": "2016-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "endDate": "2016-12-31T00:00:00Z"
          },
          "id": "001",
          "description": "2016 Budget",
          "amount": {
            "amount": 200000,
            "currency": "GBP"
          }
        },
        {
          "period": {
            "startDate": "2017-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "endDate": "2017-12-31T00:00:00Z"
          },
          "id": "002",
          "description": "2017 Budget",
          "amount": {
            "amount": 100000,
            "currency": "GBP"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## To do

* Finalize guidance on use of extended fields in the core `planning.budget` field.
* Finalize guidance where source entity is not known at time of budgeting
