# Shareholder and ownership details

The shareholder extension can be used to provide details of the owners of parties involved in a contracting process.

For example, in Public Private Partnerships processes, companies are often required to disclose information on their ownership structures when bidding, and when the contract is awarded, information on the ownership of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) operating the contract may need to be kept up to date during project implementation.

Because each owner mentioned in the shareholders array should also gain an entry in the 'parties' array, it is possible to use this extension to build up information on corporate ownership networks involved in a contracting process.

## Beneficial ownership

This extension also includes a 'stub' entry for recording beneficial ownership information against a party.

At present this includes space for free-text description of ownership and control structures, but this may be further extended with structured beneficial ownership information drawing on the draft [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](https://github.com/openownership/data-standard).
