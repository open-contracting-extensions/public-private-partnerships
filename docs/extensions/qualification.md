# Qualification (profile use only)

This extension forms part of the [OCDS for PPPs profile](http://standard.open-contracting.org/profiles/ppp/) which adds a qualification section between planning and tender. 

Profiles re-purpose elements of the OCDS data model, but are not backwards compatible with OCDS.

In particular, this extension adds a second initiation stage (`qualification`), which is incompatible with the OCDS 1.x definition of a Contracting Process.

This extension should not be used outside of the PPP Profile. 

For more background on this extension, see discussion in [#36](https://github.com/open-contracting/public-private-partnerships/issues/36).
