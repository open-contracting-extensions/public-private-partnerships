## OCDS for Public Private Partnerships

The Open Contracting Data Standard for Public Private Partnerships release draws together a number of general extensions.

Full documentation is available at [http://standard.open-contracting.org/profiles/ppp/latest/en/](http://standard.open-contracting.org/profiles/ppp/latest/en/)

This extension provides a number of fields and building blocks that are currenetly seen as specific to PPP disclosure against the World Bank PPP Disclosure Framework.

### Project level information

Building on the [Budget and Projects extension](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds_budget_projects_extension) this adds to project with:

* Sector classifications - using the [UN Classifications of the Functions of Government](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=4)
* Additional classifications - allowing arbitrary additional project categorisation
* Project location - with options for gazetteer or point location

An example is shown below:

                                    },

                                            }
                                        }
                                    ]
                                }
                            }
                  }
        
        ]
}

```

### Evaluation Indicators

The PPP disclosure framework calls for a number of different indicators to be reported relating to governments evaluation of a PPP project.

The ```award/evaluationIndicators``` section includes properties to express the **value** and supporting **free-text details** for each indicator:

* discountRate
* riskPremium
* netPresentValue

### Finance Summary

The PPP disclosure framework calls for a number of different indicators relating to the financial model of a PPP project. Whilst some of these may be reported as metrics on an ongoing basis, some are simple single values.

The ```contract/financeSummary``` section includes properties to express the **value** and supporting **free-text details** for each indicator:

* debtEquityRatio
* shareCapital
* subsidyRatio
