# Framework reference

```{image} _static/images/disclosure-framework.png
```

[The World Bank Framework for Disclosure in Public Private Partnership Projects](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/publicprivatepartnerships/brief/ppp-tools#T1) provides a comprehensive overview of motivations, processes and legal frameworks for disclosure of information in Public Private Partnership projects.

This section provides a step-by-step reference resource on how all the requirements from the disclosure template in the framework can be captured as structured data and documents using OCDS for PPPs. Individual implementations of the framework may vary with respect to the elements of disclosure they prioritize.

This section should be read in conjunction with the Disclosure Framework.

The mapping for each requirement in the framework includes a guide to publication timing, indicating whether information should be **P**ublished, **R**epeated or **U**pdated at each stage of the contracting process. More information on the stages of the contracting process can be found in the [publication timing section](timing.md).

## I. Basic Project Information

<div class="disclosure-timing">

PP | P | A | CC | I | R
-- | - | - | -- | - | -
P  | R | R | R  | R | R
</div>

### I.1. Name, location and sector

Each project should have a name, location and sectoral classification.

This information is included in the `planning/project` section of each release. A detailed breakdown of each field is given below.

**JSON example:**

```{jsoninclude} examples/full.json
:jsonpointer: /releases/0/planning/project
```

**Flattened example** (showing top-level fields only)

```{jsoninclude-flat} examples/full.json
:class: flattened-example
:jsonpointer: /releases/0/planning/project
:ignore_path: /releases/0/
```

#### I.1.1. Project name and description

These titles and descriptions can be used by applications in summary lists, so should be kept concise and jargon free.

We recommend keeping descriptions to one paragraph or less.

**Schema**: Information can be provided using the following OCDS fields.

```{jsonschema} _static/patched/release-schema.json
:include: planning/project/title,planning/project/description
:collapse:
:nocrossref:
```

#### I.1.2. Project sector

Projects should be classified using the UN Classification of the Functions of Government Scheme (COFOG).

This can be cross-walked to most other PPP classification schemes in use, and so provides a common framework for understanding the sectoral focus of investments.

**Schema**: Information can be provided using the following OCDS fields.

```{jsonschema} _static/patched/release-schema.json
:include: planning/project/sector
:collapse:
:nocrossref:
```

##### I.1.2.1. Project sector (additional)

One or more additional project classifications can be provided if required by a particular user of the data, or to relate the project to a national taxonomy.

**Schema**: Information can be provided using the following OCDS fields.

```{jsonschema} _static/patched/release-schema.json
:include: planning/project/additionalClassifications
:collapse:
:nocrossref:
```

Additional classification schemes can also be provided, such as project classification against the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), or against national frameworks.

#### I.1.3. Project location

The locations where a project is taking place can be specified using:

* **A gazetteer entry**. For example, the GeoNames code of the administrative division where activity is taking place.
* **A GeoJSON object**. Describing the boundary, or extent, of where activity will take place.

There are a range of tools available to generate GeoJSON data, such as [http://geojson.io/](http://geojson.io)

**Schema**: Information can be provided using the following OCDS fields.

```{jsonschema} _static/patched/release-schema.json
:include: planning/project/locations
:collapse:
:nocrossref:
```

## II. Procurement Information

> Dates and summary details, links to all procurement documents, final feasibility study, including land acquisition, social, environmental, and rehabilitation related information, reports of independent procurement auditors (if any)

Procurement procedures can involve one or more competitive stages:

* In a single-stage procedure, the procuring entity invites suppliers to submit bids, without submitting any prior information.
* In a multi-stage procedure, the procuring entity invites suppliers to submit requests to participate in a first stage (pre-qualification). The procuring entity assesses the requests, and establishes a list of qualified suppliers to invite to submit bids. Qualified suppliers then submit bids in a second stage. The procuring entity assesses the bids, and awards a contract to the winning bidder.

In OCDS, the `tender` section represents the invitation to participate (whether to submit bids, or to submit requests to participate) and is also used to describe the procedure as a whole.

### II.1. First stage

> The act of testing prospective bidders to determine whether they meet the pass/fail qualification criteria in advance of issuing the request for proposals. ([Source](https://ppp-certification.com/ppp-certification-guide/glossary))

Use the `tender` section to describe the first stage of the contracting process, whether it involves the submission of bids, or requests to participate.
